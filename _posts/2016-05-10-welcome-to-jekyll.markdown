You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

{% graphviz "testgraph.png" %}
    digraph {
            a -> b[label="0.2",weight="0.2"];
            a -> c[label="0.4",weight="0.4"];
            c -> b[label="0.6",weight="0.6"];
            c -> e[label="0.6",weight="0.6"];
            e -> e[label="0.1",weight="0.1"];
            e -> b[label="0.7",weight="0.7"];
        }
{% endgraphviz %}
